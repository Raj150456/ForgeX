# ForgeX

**Live Demo:** [https://forge-x-pi.vercel.app/](https://forge-x-pi.vercel.app/)

## Overview

**ForgeX** is a frontend learning project developed as part of my exploration of **TypeScript-based UI development**.
The primary goal of this project was to understand how TypeScript can be used to structure frontend logic, manage interactions, and build a clean, responsive user interface, while also learning how to deploy a static web application.

This project is **student-level and learning-focused**, with emphasis on experimentation, iteration, and understanding the codebase rather than building a production system.

## Development Approach (Transparency Note)

ForgeX was developed using **AI-assisted coding** as a learning accelerator (vibe-coding using *Google Antigravity*).
I was responsible for:

* Defining the project idea and scope
* Deciding UI structure and features
* Guiding and refining AI-generated code
* Debugging issues and making corrections
* Testing functionality locally
* Deploying the application on Vercel

AI tools were used as **development assistants**, not as a replacement for understanding the code.


## Key Features

* Interactive frontend components written in TypeScript
* Responsive layout styled using plain CSS
* Simple client-side interactions to practice DOM manipulation and TypeScript patterns
* Live deployment using Vercel for easy access and testing


## Tech Stack

* **TypeScript**
* **CSS**
* **Vercel** (for static deployment)


## Live Demo

🔗 [https://forge-x-pi.vercel.app/](https://forge-x-pi.vercel.app/)

The project is deployed using **Vercel**, allowing the application to be accessed and tested live without local setup.


## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raj150456/ForgeX.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ForgeX
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if applicable):

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm start
   ```

5. Open the URL shown in the terminal
   (commonly `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`).

If the project is a static TypeScript build:

* Run the build script (if present)
* Serve the generated output directory using a static server


## What I Learned

* Basics of setting up and using **TypeScript** in frontend projects
* Structuring a small frontend codebase for readability and maintainability
* Writing typed logic for UI interactions
* Debugging frontend issues and refining AI-generated code
* Deploying a static web project using **Vercel**
* Documenting a project clearly for reviewers and interview discussions


## Future Improvements

* Add screenshots or a short demo GIF to visually explain the UI
* Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, contrast)
* Add clearer run/build scripts in the README
* Introduce simple tests for core UI behavior
* Refactor components for better scalability and readability


## Notes for Interviews

* Be prepared to explain:

  * One UI component and how it works
  * One issue encountered during development and how it was fixed
  * How TypeScript helped improve code clarity or reduce errors
* Clearly explain how AI tools were used responsibly as part of the learning process
