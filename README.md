**🎓 Student Project** • **📚 Learning-Focused** • **🤖 AI-Assisted Development**

## 📖 Overview

**ForgeX** is a frontend learning project developed as part of my exploration into **TypeScript-based UI development**. The primary goal was to understand how TypeScript can be used to structure frontend logic, manage interactions, and build a clean, responsive user interface, while also learning the deployment workflow.

> 💡 This project is **student-level and learning-focused**, with emphasis on experimentation, iteration, and understanding the codebase rather than building a production system.

---

## 🎯 Development Approach (Transparency Note)

ForgeX was developed using **AI-assisted coding** as a learning accelerator (vibe-coding using _Google Antigravity_).

### 👨‍💻 My Responsibilities:

✅ Defining the project idea and scope  
✅ Deciding UI structure and features  
✅ Guiding and refining AI-generated code  
✅ Debugging issues and making corrections  
✅ Testing functionality locally  
✅ Deploying the application on Vercel

> 🤖 AI tools were used as **development assistants**, not as a replacement for understanding the code.

## ✨ Key Features

🎨 **Interactive Components** - Built with TypeScript for type-safe development  
📱 **Responsive Design** - Styled using plain CSS for cross-device compatibility  
🖱️ **Client-Side Interactions** - DOM manipulation and TypeScript patterns  
🚀 **Live Deployment** - Hosted on Vercel for instant access and testing
