# Overview

This project was built using AI-assisted coding (vibe-coding using Google Antigravity) and was not written fully from scratch manually. My role as a student involved idea conception, feature planning, prompting and guiding AI output, debugging/fixing, testing, and deployment to Vercel. This is a learning-focused, AI-assisted web project.
